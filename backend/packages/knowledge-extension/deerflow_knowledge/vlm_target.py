"""Resolve the caption VLM's (model, endpoint, key) triple, and the protocol it speaks.

Both caption legs are raw HTTP calls, and what they send depends on the entry's provider:
the OpenAI shape (``POST {base_url}/chat/completions``) or Anthropic's Messages shape
(``POST {base_url}/v1/messages``). Naming a configured ``models:`` entry supplies the triple
from that entry — which is what lets the settings UI offer a plain model picker instead of
asking for an endpoint and a key that the entry already carries — and the entry's ``use:``
class is what decides the dialect.

There is no second path any more (spec 2026-09-23 D10.3): a value that names no entry is a
configuration error raised by the resolver, not a bare model id pointed at a retired
endpoint, and an entry's address is its own or the one its SDK ships (D10.2).
